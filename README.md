# Inventory System

## Activity Title
**Simple Inventory Management System**

## Problem Description
Create an inventory program using Python that manages items and their prices. The program uses two data structures:
- A **list** to store item names
- A **dictionary** to store the corresponding item prices

The system allows users to:

1. **Add a new item**
   - Ask for the item name
   - Ask for the price
   - Add it to both the list and dictionary
   - Prevent duplicate item names
   - Validate that the price is a valid positive number

2. **Update the price of an existing item**
   - Ask for the item name
   - If it exists, update its price with validation
   - If it doesn't exist, show an error message

3. **Exit the system**

The program uses loops and conditionals for the menu system and includes comprehensive error handling for:
- Empty inputs
- Invalid price formats
- Negative prices
- Duplicate items
- Non-existent items
